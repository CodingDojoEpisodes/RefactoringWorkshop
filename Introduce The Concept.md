Hi, and welcome to the Coding Dojo. The place where we practice our coding skills.
Come on in. Please take a seat.
This series of episodes is all about refactoring. One of the most important programming skills a software developer should possess.
For me it’s a fact, Refactoring completely changed the way I approach software development. 
It changed my life, it may change yours.
BTW, I’m Dr. Code, and I’ll be your instructor.
1. I:
Ho, and as you noticed, we are not alone here, besides you and me we also have 
1. I:
Grouchy,
1. G:
Hey.
1. I:
Grouchy is a software veteran, he has been writing software since the ’70s.
He has seen it all, and he is a little stubborn, though, deep inside, he is open to new ideas.
1. I:
Newbie,
1. N:
Hey.
1. I:
He is fresh out of college, He is about to start his first job as a software developer, and he is very excited about that.
1. I:
And Sharp
1. S:
Hi.
1. I:
Well, she is sharp. A talented developer with 5 years of experience.
1. I:
They will ask the hard questions and take part in the discussion.
1. I:
Now, you may ask yourself, why are we all animated characters.
1. N:
Wow, wow, wait a minute! What do you mean by animated characters? Are you suggesting we’re not real?
1. S:
Oh, trust me, I'm a 100% real!
1. I:
I’m so sorry, I had no clue you are not aware. 
We are all, including me, just thoughts and ideas in the mind of our creators and viewers.
If you think about it, there are many advantages in being animated characters. For a start, we will never get old.
1. N:
Wow, that's an interesting thought.
1. I:
So, where was I? Oh, I was just saying that you may ask yourself, why are we all animated characters?
Why not just a regular green screen video? Or, even a simple recorded presentation?
Well, the answer is that just like with a software project, we think of this video as a living product.
We want to be able to make fast changes and improvements based on your feedback.
With animation, there is no need for a studio or long recording days. 
We just change the script and voila, we have a new version of the video.
Actually, the script of the video is by itself an open source project.
If you have suggestions for how to improve these videos,
You are more than welcome to make changes to the script and submit a pull request.
If your pull request is approved, it will be included in the next version of the video.
1. I:
So, shall we start?
