Hi, and welcome to the Coding Dojo. The place where we practice our coding skills.
1. T:
Come on in. Please take a seat.
1. T:
This series of episodes is all about refactoring. One of the most important programming skills a software developer should possess.
1. T:
For me it’s a fact, Refactoring completely changed the way I approach software development. 
1. T:
It changed my life, it might as well change yours.
1. T:
BTW, I’m Dr. Code, and I’ll be your instructor.
1. T:
Ho, and as you noticed, we are not alone here, besides you and me we also have 
1. T:
Grouchy,
1. G:
Hey.
1. T:
Grouchy is a software veteran, he has been writing software since the ’70s.
1. T:
He has seen it all, and he is a little stubborn, though, deep inside, he is open to new ideas.
1. T:
Newbie,
1. N:
Hey.
1. T:
He is fresh out of college, He is about to start his first job as a software developer, and he is very excited about that.
1. T:
And Sharp
1. S:
Hi.
1. T:
Well, she is sharp. A talented developer with 5 years of experience.
1. T:
They will ask the hard questions and take part in the discussion.
1. T:
Now, you may ask yourself, why are we all animated characters.
1. N:
Wow, wow, wait a minute! What do you mean by animated characters? Are you suggesting we’re not real?
1. T:
I’m so sorry, I had no clue you are not aware. 
1. T:
We are all, including me, just thoughts and ideas in the mind of our creators and viewers.
1. T:
If you think about it, there are many advantages in being animated characters. For a start, we will never get old.
1. N:
Wow, that's an interesting thought.
1. T:
So, where was I? Oh, I was just saying that you may ask yourself, why are we all animated characters?
1. T:
Why not just a regular green screen video? Or, even a simple recorded presentation?
1. T:
Well, the answer is that just like with a software project, we think of this video as a living product.
1. T:
We want to be able to make fast changes and improvements based on your feedback.
1. T:
With animation, there is no need for a studio or long recording days. 
1. T:
We just change the script and voila, we have a new version of the video.
1. T:
Actually, the script of the video is by itself an open source project.
1. T:
If you have suggestions for how to improve these videos,
You are more than welcome to make changes to the script and submit a pull request.
1. T:
If your pull request is approved, it will be included in the next version of the video.
1. T:
So, shall we start?
